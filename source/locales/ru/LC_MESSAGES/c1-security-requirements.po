"A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality that "
"ensures one of many different security properties of software is being "
"satisfied. Security requirements are derived from industry standards, "
"applicable laws, and a history of past vulnerabilities. Security "
"requirements define new features or additions to existing features to solve "
"a specific security problem or eliminate a potential vulnerability."

"Security requirements provide a foundation of vetted security functionality "
"for an application. Instead of creating a custom approach to security for "
"every application, standard security requirements allow developers to reuse "
"the definition of security controls and best practices. Those same vetted "
"security requirements provide solutions for security issues that have "
"occurred in the past. Requirements exist to prevent the repeat of past "
"security failures."
