"Exception handling is a programming concept that allows an application to "
"respond to different error states (like network down, or database connection"
" failed, etc) in various ways. Handling exceptions and errors correctly is "
"critical to making your code reliable and secure."

"Information leakage: Leaking sensitive information in error messages can "
"unintentionally help attackers. For example, an error that returns a stack "
"trace or other internal error details can provide an attacker with "
"information about your environment. Even small differences in handling "
"different error conditions (e.g., returning \"invalid user\" or \"invalid "
"password\" on authentication errors) can provide valuable clues to "
"attackers. As described above, be sure to log error details for forensics "
"and debugging purposes, but donâ€™t expose this information, especially to an "
"external client."
