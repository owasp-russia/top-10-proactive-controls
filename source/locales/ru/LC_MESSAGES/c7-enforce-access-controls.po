"Access Control (or Authorization) is the process of granting or denying "
"specific requests from a user, program, or process. Access control also "
"involves the act of granting and revoking those privileges."

"Access Control functionality often spans many areas of software depending on"
" the complexity of the access control system. For example, managing access "
"control metadata or building caching for scalability purposes are often "
"additional components in an access control system that need to be built or "
"managed. There are several different types of access control design that "
"should be considered."

"Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a means of restricting access to "

"Once you have chosen a specific access control design pattern, it is often "
"difficult and time consuming to re-engineer access control in your "
