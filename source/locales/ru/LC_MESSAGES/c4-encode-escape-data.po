"Encoding and escaping are defensive techniques meant to stop injection "
"attacks. Encoding (commonly called \"Output Encoding\") involves translating"
" special characters into some different but equivalent form that is no "
"longer dangerous in the target interpreter, for example translating the  "
"character into the  string when writing to an HTML page. Escaping involves "
"adding a special character before the character/string to avoid it being "
"misinterpreted, for example, adding a  character before a  (double quote) "
"character so that it is interpreted as text and not as closing a string."

"Output encoding is best applied just before the content is passed to the "
"target interpreter. If this defense is performed too early in the processing"
" of a request then the encoding or escaping may interfere with the use of "
"the content in other parts of the program. For example if you HTML escape "
"content before storing that data in the database and the UI automatically "
"escapes that data a second time then the content will not display properly "
"due to being double escaped."

"Contextual output encoding is a crucial security programming technique "
"needed to stop XSS. This defense is performed on output, when you're "
"building a user interface, at the last moment before untrusted data is "
"dynamically added to HTML. The type of encoding will depend on the location "
"(or context) in the document where data is being displayed or stored. The "
"different types of encoding that would be used for building secure user "
"interfaces includes HTML Entity Encoding, HTML Attribute Encoding, "
"JavaScript Encoding, and URL Encoding."
