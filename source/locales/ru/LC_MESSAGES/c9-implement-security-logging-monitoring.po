"Logging is a concept that most developers already use for debugging and "
"diagnostic purposes. Security logging is an equally basic concept: to log "
"security information during the runtime operation of an application. "
"Monitoring is the live review of application and security logs using various"
" forms of automation. The same tools and patterns can be used for "
"operations, debugging and security purposes."
