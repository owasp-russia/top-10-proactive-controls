"Attackers can steal data from web and webservice applications in a number of"
" ways. For example, if sensitive information in sent over the internet  "

"use SQL Injection to steal passwords and other credentials from an "
"applications database and expose that information to the public."

"It's critical to classify data in your system and determine which level of "
"sensitivity each piece of data belongs to. Each data category can then be "
"mapped to protection rules necessary for each level of sensitivity. For "
"example, public marketing information that is not sensitive may be "
"categorized as public data which is ok to place on the public website. "
"Credit card numbers may be classified as private user data which may need to"
" be encrypted while stored or in transit."

"When transmitting sensitive data over any network, end-to-end communications"
" security (or encryption-in-transit) of some kind should be considered. TLS "
"is by far the most common and widely supported cryptographic protocol for "
"communications security. It is used by many types of applications (web, "
"webservice, mobile) to communicate over a network in a secure fashion. TLS "
"must be properly configured in a variety of ways in order to properly defend"

"Cryptography (or crypto) is one of the more advanced topics of information "

"thoroughly understood by web solution architects and developers. In "
"addition, serious cryptography research is typically based in advanced "
