"SQL Injection occurs when untrusted user input is dynamically added to a SQL"
" query in an insecure manner, often via basic string concatenation. SQL "
"Injection is one of the most dangerous application security risks. SQL "
"Injection is easy to exploit and could lead to the entire database being "
"stolen, wiped, or modified. The application can even be used to run "
"dangerous commands against the operating system hosting your database, "
"thereby giving an attacker a foothold on your network."

"In order to mitigate SQL injection, untrusted input should be prevented from"

"Certain locations in a database query are not parameterizable. These "
"locations are different for each database vendor. Be certain to do very "
"careful exact-match validation or manual escaping when confronting database "
"query parameters that cannot be bound to a parameterized query. Also, while "
"the use of parameterized queries largely has a positive impact on "
"performance, certain parameterized queries in specific database "
"implementations will affect performance negatively. Be sure to test queries "
"for performance; especially complex queries with extensive like clause or "
"text searching capabilities."
