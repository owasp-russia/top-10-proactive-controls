"This document is intended to provide initial awareness around building "
"secure software. This document will also provide a good foundation of topics"
" to help drive introductory software security developer training. These "
"controls should be used consistently and thoroughly throughout all "
"applications. However, this document should be seen as a starting point "
"rather than a comprehensive set of techniques and practices. A full secure "
"development process should include comprehensive requirements from a "
"standard such as the OWASP ASVS in addition to including a range of software"
" development activities described in maturity models such as OWASP SAMM and "
"BSIMM."
